Nikka Miyagikyo Peated,"Rarely distilled in Miyagikyo, it is nevertheless a heavily peated malt that has been selected to be blended with lightly peated malts. The result is a single malt with the typical character of the distillery but strongly marked by the peat.
Elegant from the beginning to the end, the peat does not appear distinctly on the nose, leaving the place to fruity notes of red and exotic fruits, and to woody notes of slightly smoked oak. On the other hand, on the palate, the peat spreads smoothly bringing to the fruity aromas some very surprising iodine and salt notes that will persist until the finish during which some bitter notes of cocoa will fly in retro olfaction.",Bottle,https://arweave.net/T-c1SVNtgLNQR1opLsiPWKOkCdVH_LIHGfkRwnreWpw,https://arweave.net/CK710c9oN6AENVTtfRowZeH4-NXRNi3xSb7BRicuM90,"532,00",2,Japan,Nikka,,Single Malt,48.0% ABV,700ml,,,Draft,,,Nikka Whisky,Nikka,

James Martin Fine & Rare 30 Years,"James Martin Fine & Rare 30 Years is an exceptionally aged premium blended Scotch whisky. This blend is crafted from a selection of high-quality single malt and grain whiskies, each matured for at least 30 years before blending.
The extended aging process contributes to a remarkably complex and refined flavor profile. Typically, a 30-year-old blended Scotch like this would offer an intricate bouquet of aromas and flavors that have developed over three decades of maturation.
On the nose, you might expect rich, deep aromas of dried fruits, perhaps figs or raisins, along with notes of dark chocolate, oak, and subtle spices. There could also be hints of leather and tobacco, characteristic of well-aged whiskies.
The palate is likely to be smooth and full-bodied, with a harmonious blend of flavors. You might taste layers of sweetness reminiscent of honey or toffee, balanced by oak tannins, dried fruit notes, and perhaps a touch of smoke or nuttiness. The finish would typically be long, warm, and complex, leaving a lingering impression of its extended maturation.
This whisky represents a significant investment in time and expertise. It's a premium product aimed at connoisseurs and collectors who appreciate the depth and complexity that comes with extensive aging.
