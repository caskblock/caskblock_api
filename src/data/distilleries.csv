James Martin,James Martin,"James Martin, known as ‚ÄòSparry‚Äô to his acquaintances because of his prowess in the boxing ring, set up in business as a whisky merchant in Edinburgh during 1878. He had previously worked as a travelling salesman for Leith whisky merchant John H Bartram.\n\nMartin developed lucrative export markets for his whiskies, and this area of activity gained greater importance when the firm was being run by his partner, Edward Macdonald, whose brother Daniel joined him in the firm after Martin‚Äôs death in 1899. Indeed, from 1933, Martin‚Äôs blends were among the top 10 premium brands in the US. The brands in question included James Martin‚Äôs VVO Gold Bar 8-year-old, James Martin‚Äôs De Luxe 12-year-old, James Martin‚Äôs Fine and Rare 20-year-old.\n\nJames Martin & Co Ltd was acquired by Glenmorangie brand owner Macdonald & Muir Ltd in 1912, and today, with the French luxury goods firm Louis Vuitton-Mo√´t Hennessy (LVMH) owning Glenmorangie, the company remains a non-trading subsidiary, with a registered address at Glenmorangie‚Äôs Edinburgh headquarters.\n\nAfter the purchase of Glenmorangie by LVMH in 2004, the James Martin brand of blended whiskies was discontinued.",,https://arweave.net/bYS2af2ZGGYGEjg5nRtKz2RW43yLjg1QI2s7DOCDr7o,"James Martin Fine & Rare 30 Years,James Martin Fine & Rare 20 Years"

Sakurao Distillery,Togouchi,"The Sakurao Distillery was founded in 2017, near the Seto inland sea. It relies on more than a century of expertise gained by producing traditional Japanese spirits. Sakurao is now part of a very limited group of Japanese distilleries able to produce 100% Japanese whiskies as all the malt and grain whiskies used in their blends are distilled through its stills.\n\nThe art of distilling is thoughtfully cultivated at Sakurao Distillery.\nFor malt distillation, the swan neck of the pot still is purposedly modified to retain more esters and design more complex whiskies. A hybrid still is then used for the second distillation, which results in a higher alcohol volume than usual and fruitier whiskies.\nFor grain distillation, made out of barley, the traditional still that used to be operated for shochu production is used. A second distillation is then operated in a still designed by Sakurao, using the traditional iron still topped with a distillation column. This process leads to a light and floral whisky profile.\n\nThe casks are brought to their underground cellar in the small town of Akiota-Togouchi. This unusual setting makes it possible to control the environmental factors that are decisive in obtaining the desired aromatic profile. This slows down the extraction of aromas from the barrel and explains the elegant profile of the Togouchi range as well as its light colour.",,https://arweave.net/l40EZDSmGq4Qd31o5R41eKcWwm3hzsfBuooM39nzJ7Q,Togouchi Pure Malt
